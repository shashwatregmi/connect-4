# connect-4

C++ project based on the popular Connect 4 board game. 

Currently this project is a one player game with two levels where the user is playing against the computer.
The program uses two dimensional vectors to create the playing board and takes inputs from the user to place the checkers.
Next, the computer places a checker on the board (placement dependant on difficulty) and this process repeats until four checkers have been placed  side by side and a winner can be determined.
